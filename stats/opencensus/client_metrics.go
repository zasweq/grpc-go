// fixing import:
// manually put changes into citc
// fix the p2c diff
// delete GOA exemption

// you can run tests and stuff but you don't need to...run them through cl front end


// then interop on call stuff

// then per call latency stuff/design docs


// filtering out will need a new pr with a client option to disable global
// options - perhaps wait on import to go through?
// then use that with my musings about filtering in that pr


// Oh also have his tracing comments now

// top level ctx population per package

// o(2n) on every event, smaller you can make that the better
// metrics stuff
// traces stuff

// think about it

// md needs to be immutable...stores updates to md in the middle of context hierarchy
// both grpc metadata, ctx value needs to be immutable
// because of derived context logic, you don't want it to change for all of them

// fill it out once at beginning

// then repull it out of context
// wrapper for
//     span
//     message id
//     all the metrics data

// how does the disableTrace boolean gate relate to this?
// you only have to turn on one, but you can still reuse this memory


// add the three bullet points for how to link traces/span

// tagRPC
//   info :=  statsTagRPC
//   info :=  traceTagRPC
//   concatanate info and store in context, return context




// (how will this happen wrt aggregation between metrics and traces, return data
// then aggregate at top level tagRPC call?)

// handleRPC
// pull Data out of context, if nil return
// statsTagRPC
// traceTagRPC

// disableTrace just gate both tagRPC and handleRPC calls? (and eventually top
// level interceptor)






// note: traces disable trace bit done once traces pr merged
// as part of filtering out calls to cloudops endpoints
