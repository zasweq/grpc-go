package opentelemetry




// I've already written this out and thought about it


type nonPerCallInterface struct {}

// was it those typed interfaces




// if it does implement non per call, record using that []    in balancers




// does it need a []   slice layer to forward to?
type somethingList struct {} // ?





// what is that extra non per call interface on? the otel stats plugin type?



// look for my non per call musings?
