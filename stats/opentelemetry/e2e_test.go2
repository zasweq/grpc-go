// Tasks
// Cleanup
// Go get the sdk


// go get at master to see if tests work
// then they need to perform a (stable?) release...but David mentioned it's a few months from being stable.
// so I can use it in my code

// It's stable wrt emitted metrics might change some names around so I'm good wrt writing tests



// maybe I need to update OTel Go to recent version to pull in reader/sdk

// TestAllMetricsOneFunction tests emitted metrics from gRPC. It then configures
// a system with a gRPC Client and gRPC server with the OpenTelemetry Dial and
// Server Option configured specifying all the metrics provided by this package,
// and makes a Unary RPC and a Streaming RPC. These two RPCs should cause
// certain recording for each registered metric observed through a Manual
// Metrics Reader on the SDK's Meter Provider.
